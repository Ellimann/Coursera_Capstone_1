Capstone Project Notebook
The context of the capstone project:
This present project give us the opportunity to be creative and come up with our own idea or problem to solve using location data. For example, we can choose to compare different neighborhoods in terms of a service, search for potential explanation of why a neighborhood is popular, the cause of complaints in another neighborhood, or anything else related to neighborhoods. Hence the name of the capstone project will be the Battle of the neighborhoods. So what you will learn to do is given a city like the City of Toronto, you will segment it into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data and machine learning, we will group the neighbourhoods into clusters. So in summary, with this capstone project we will be able to work on something exciting of our own creativity. We will be required to leverage location data to solve a problem or to get deeper insights into a neighborhoods reputation.
